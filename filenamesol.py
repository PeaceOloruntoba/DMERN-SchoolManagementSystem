# This code uses the scipy.stats.expon module to calculate the probabilities based on the exponential distribution. The cdf function (cumulative distribution function) is used to calculate the probabilities for different ranges. The scale parameter is set to 1/rate_parameter to match the rate parameter specified in the problem.
# When you run this code, it will output the calculated probabilities for waiting times less than 5 minutes, greater than or equal to 10 minutes, and between 5 and 10 minutes.
